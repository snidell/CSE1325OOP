Logical error report

First logical error was encountered with the Time() constructor class that would build a time object
with zero seconds and zero hundreth of seconds regardless if it had passed values in. This was fixed by extending
the string constructor to except these values using the parseInt and split methods used for hour and Minute

Second logical error was implementing the compareTo method in DateTime class. It was not returning the correct
value of the result. The initial if statement was using the isBefore method from the ttime and date classes.
However this was not turning providing the correct result for the if statement. After speaking with the TA
he discovered that the compareTo method of each time and date class was required to obtain correct results

Third logical error was in implementing the add minutes class. I miss understood what the return value was
of each addSecond minute, hour etc. I beleived it returned the over flowing value of the superceeding value but
it was returning the over flow of days always regardless if second minute or hour was called.

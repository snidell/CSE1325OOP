Logical Error 1

When adding an employee with a null release date errors were popping up and a comparison in the if statement was not working
I was taking it as the null value instead of the "null" string. 

-To fix this the DateTime was taken in as a string and evaluation was made: If it .equals("Null"); then create a
release DateTime= null; //the value null.

Logical Error 2
Another logical error was passing in this release date as a DateTime object.

-To fix this i changed it to a String so i could do valution checking as describe in logic error 1

Logical Error 2

Parsing the scanner input proved difficult switching between strings and intergers that had to be lexigraphically
evaluated. This was encountered while creating the menu with an option of * or a number. The number was used to 
print a range above the given number.
-The fix. I emailed you and spoke with the professor on how to the attack the problem and research a bit more.
I finally checked created a string scanner and checked first if it was a *star, if not i did a try catch to do an
Integer parse on the String scanner if it failed. I prompted the user as invalid input. if correct i took it in
as a number given.

Logical Error 3
Several Constructors had to be appended to take in the correct info from the dataFile. For instance  i didn't expect
for Customer class that we would be taking in the state as a seperate string. 

-To fix this I added this to the constructor parameters along with an attribute to hold it

Logigical Error 4

Accessing private attributes of classes. This happened multiple times. As i want take the professors suggestion
in keeping as many attributes as private I made get methods as necessary for that attribute instead of setting the attribute
to public. This way i had communication between the classes but the attributes were hidden from the world.

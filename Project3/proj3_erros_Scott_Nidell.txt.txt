Project 3 Logical Erros

Error 1
Array outof Bounds. 
This error was encountered when looping through the first array of employees and trying to access pastEmployees.
I was using the size (i< employees.size())of one array to access elements of another array leading to running out of bounds on the smaller
array. This was fixed and changed to correctly use the right size of the arraylist

Error 2
Null Pointer Exception
I was trying to add items to an Arraylist that memory was not yet allocated for. instared of private ArrayList<Stuff> myStuff=new ArrayList<Item>();
I just had ArrayList<Stuff> myStuff. This does not allocated anymemory to tge Arraylist and when dynamically swapping items throws a Null Pointer

Error 3
When bringing in a release Date for employee I kept it stored a string instead of as  a null date. When comparing null to the string "null" i was not getting the 
the correct output with my if statements.
